Ogre Procedural
---------------

Ogre Procedural is a C++ library which aims to produce procedural geometry for Ogre3D.

It is licensed under the MIT license, which basically means you can do anything you want with it, including using it in a commercial, closed source program.
Although not compulsory, it is also considered to be nice if you provide a link to ogre-procedural in your product's credits.
